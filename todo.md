To do:
- refactor
- check 'TODO' comments
- disable unused routes from FOSUserBundle

New features:
- email newsletter (enable email sending - review reset password email as well)
- new edit profile page, without the password

Maybe:
- top menu to show active page
- make delete use the proper verb. And alert on click
- properly rename routes
- tests for the listing page
- functionality for delaying
- registration placeholders
- registration emails?
- Manage Tasks table -> add 'Next Due'
